Way back in 2012, when I first heard about [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/), I recreated a maze game that I played on the PDP-10 and Imlac terminals at MIT in the late 1970s. In that game, a bunch of players ran around a shared maze, shooting at each other.

That game was up at [jsmaze.com](jsmaze.com) for many years, but I took it down recently, to save the $15/month that its AWS VM was costing me. I spent a little time attempting to make it work again, but the libraries it depends on have changed incompatibily, and having been spoiled by Elm, I didn't want to spend the effort it would take to figure it out.

This project is a remake, from scratch, in Elm.
